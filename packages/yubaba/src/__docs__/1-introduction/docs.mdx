## What is yubaba???

It's all about **animation** 🧙✨ - it can help with:

- [Moving an element](/move) from one position to another
- [Revealing elements](/reveal-move) like you see above
- [Supporting animations](/circle-expand) by obstructing elements in view; and
- [Hiding children elements](/baba-manager) until animations have completed to trick users 🤫
- [Orchestrating](/advanced-usage#wait-for-the-previous-animation-to-finish-before-starting-the-next) when animations should happen and [in what order](/advanced-usage#controlling-in-what-order-animations-should-execute)
- Composing animations together to create [composite animations](/cross-fade-move)
- [Anything you can imagine](/custom-animations), seriously 🤩

## Installation

`yubaba` has a peer dependency on [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) for some of the more advanced animations.

```bash
npm install yubaba react@^16.4.x react-dom@^16.4.x emotion@^9.x.x --save
```

or

```bash
yarn add yubaba react@^16.4.x react-dom@^16.4.x emotion@^9.x.x
```
