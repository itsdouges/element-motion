# Troubleshooting

## Animations aren't starting

Sometimes a [Baba](/baba) element is reused by React if the markup where the [Baba](/baba) element was rendered didn't change.
To get around this you can use [React `key` prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#keys) to force each [Baba](/baba) to re-mount.

## TypeError: Cannot read property 'getBoundingClientRect' of undefined

Your target `ref` is probably not being set correctly.
Double check your [Baba](/baba) elements.

> ** Tip -** If you're having trouble getting ahold of a `ref` think about adding some extra wrapper markup.

```diff
<Baba>
  {baba => (
+    <div {...baba}>
+      <MyComponent />
-      <MyComponent {...baba} />
+    </div>
  )}
</Baba>
```
